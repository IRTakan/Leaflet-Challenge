# Leaflet-Challenge

In this challenge i'm using The United States Geological Survey earthqauke dataset. They are responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect large amounts of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. I have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

To complete this task I had to:

--Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization--

-Get the USGS dataset that covers earthquakes over the past week (7 days).

Import and visualize the data by doing the following:

- Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

- Make sure that the data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

- Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

- Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.

--Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data--

- Plot on my map where it illustartes the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Make sure the earthquakes are also included. 

- Add other base maps to choose from.

- Put each dataset into separate overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

- Add layer controls to your map.
